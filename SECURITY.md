## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues by sending an email to lquixada@gmail.com.

Do __not__ submit an issue ticket or pull request or otherwise publicly
disclose the issue.

After receiving your email, the author will respond as soon as possible and suggest
a plan of action.


## Disclosure policy

After confirming a vulnerability, the author will generally release a security update
as soon as possible, including the minimum amount of information required for
software maintainers and system administrators to assess the urgency of the
update for their particular situation.

The publication of any further details such as code comments,
tests, commit history and diffs will be postponed in order to enable a substantial share of the
users to install the security fix before this time.

Upon publication of full details, the reporter will be credited if the reporter wishes
to be publicly identified.
